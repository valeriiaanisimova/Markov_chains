<h1 align="center">Markov Chains Text Generator ðŸ§ </h1>

This interactive web game uses Markov chains to control and predict the movement of the snake. Players can explore how probabilistic models influence gameplay, and experiment with different strategies to optimize movement and avoid collisions. It's a fun way to combine probability theory with game mechanics.
