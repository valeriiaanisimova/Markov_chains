---

This interactive web application leverages Markov chains to generate text sequences based on user-provided input. By analyzing the input text, the app predicts and produces coherent text that mirrors the style and structure of the original content. It's a practical demonstration of how probabilistic models can be applied to natural language processing tasks.
